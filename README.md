## Game Development Notes

* Every update shall be added here, as well as the updates in the GDD, as the development goes.

* The Game Scope may be too wide for a second project. This is expected. The challenge is to be able to develop this game with my knowledge and to find the required knowledge to develop what I won't be able to do at the moment.

* This project is expected to have a deadline in the way that it doesn't become an infinite project. This deadline will be decided and added in this document
